    <h1>COURSES OFFERED</h1>
    <div><h2>Computer Science and Engineering</h2>
        <p>It is an 8 semester Bachelor's degrees program in Computer Science & Engineering after 10+2 or equivalent. B Tech Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) focuses on the theoretical foundation of computing along with state-of-the-art development of computing solutions. CSE students learn how to design, develop and test algorithms, software, develop effective solutions to computing problems in various social, economic and organizational domains.</p>
        <h2>Electronics & Communications</h2>
        <p>Electronics and Communications Engineering is one of the most rapidly growing fields of Engineering. If you take all the current development as a holistic picture, there is over 3 times increase in demand for EC engineers per year. And it has been increasing exponentially. Hardware, Firmware and software are being more and more integrated and interdependent on one another. As things are becoming smarter every day, the need for better VLSI engineers is ever increasing. With advent of communication techniques, there is a lot of demand in the telecom industry.
        </p>
        <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
        <p>Going by the definition of civil engineering, the subject can be defined as the study, design, development and maintenance of the built environment. When we talk about build environments in the context of civil engineering, it involves both the natural environment and build environment.</p>
<h2>Machanical Engineering</h2>
<p>It is an 8 semester Bachelor's degrees program in Mechanical Engineering after 10+2 or equivalent. Mechanical engineering is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines that apply the principles of physics and materials science for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is the branch of engineering that involves the production and usage of heat and mechanical power for the design, production, and operation of machines and tools.

</p>
  <h2>Electrical Engineering</h2>
  <p>The course deals with the entire concepts of electrical engineering. Students will develop competence in the areas of Electrical Machines, Power System, Control System, Power Electronics & Drives and High Voltage Engineering. This course, from one of the top BTech Electrical Engineering Colleges in UP</p>
<h2>B. Tech (Biotechnology)</h2>
<p>B. Tech program in Biotechnology is a unique 4-years degree program which will equip students with necessary skills to act as confident bioinformaticians, molecular biotechnologists, and bioprocess engineers etc. This course is based on the premise that future industry/research enterprises require focused skill-sets in a particular vertical.

    While pursuing B. Tech degree in Biotechnology from GLA University, the students will develop practical knowledge, critical thinking, quantitative aptitude and conceptual skills and would leads to career paths in emerging health care sector and diagnostics, Research with research institutes, universities or in industry, Animal health and Vaccine industry, Agriculture, Food Technology, Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic industry, Forensic Science, Industrial and environmental Sciences, Bioinformatics and bioethics in industry regulation, Biosafety and biosecurity, and Education.</p>
